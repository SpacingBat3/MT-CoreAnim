Interpolated player animation modpack, using MineTest 5.9+ API with backwards
compatible syntax.

## About the modpack

This modpack contains library that wraps new [`ObjectRef:set_bone_override`]
API into the backwards-compatible function with [`ObjectRef:set_bone_position`]
and aims to generalise animation API, so you may use it for bone-based
animations as you please.

The API is still being worked on, so it may have a breaking changes for any kind
of extensions to [`ObjectRef:set_bone_position`] API. It may take a modders'
opinions to stabilize itself.

## Goals (and TODOs):

- [X] Provide a smooth experience for player head animation.

- [X] Basic compatibility with other mods and games, by not overwritting
  other bones animations and avoiding game-specific APIs.
  - **Note**: This means, I do not plan to implement anything that is
    not hardly dependant on `default` and `player_api` mods, those may
    be an optional dependencies, but should not be used for the core
    part of the mod.

- [X] Try to provide a backwards compatibility API, so bone overwrite
  mechanism is generalised and uses older API for older clients.

- [X] Consider making this a modpack over a single mod, to modularise
  it a bit and to alow to provide this as a library with backwards
  compatible syntax.

- [ ] Consider, if possible, replacing the official API once the modpack is
  activated, or find another way to make older mods use this over
  old API calls.

- [ ] Avoid *game exceptions*, *rule exceptions* etc. Make code generic
  enough so it can figure out any abnormalities on its own.
  - **Note**: The idea of this point is to make animations as much fitting
    into other games than MTG as possible. Some stuff however may be limited,
    due to conflicts with the game animations.

- [ ] Provide *monoids* API to resolve conflicts between game and mod
  animations.
